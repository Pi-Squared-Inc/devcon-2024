# Demo

## Demo purpose

The goal of this demo is to demonstrate that executing Solidity programs in the [K framework](https://kframework.org/) using the Solidity formal semantics achieves comparable efficiency with executing programs in Geth. Moreover, if one applies the so-called summarization optimization to the Solidity formal semantics and contract, running programs in K can become considerably faster than running them using Geth.
The measurements to support our claim can be found in the [Summary of measurements collected](##Summary-of-measurements-collected) section.

## On the semantics-based program execution
Semantics-based program execution brings not only efficiency promises, but also a correct-by-construction feature. The formal semantics of a programming language can be thought as a mathematical theory. When you feed such a mathematical theory and a specific program to K, the K framework transforms the execution of the program into a rigurous mathematical proof. Also, unlike Geth, which requires program compilation and is therefore susceptible to potential vulnerabilities from compiler bugs, semantics-based program execution removes the need for compilation. This minimizes exposure to such security risks and enhances system stability.

## Uniswap 1k swaps with Geth and K

This section includes instructions to reproduce the measurements collected as seen in table seen at the end of this section. 
The benchmark program we measured on is the `testSwapLoop` (line 696 to 704 of [swaps.sol](../src/swaps.sol)). It is run on Geth 
and the different K semantics, i.e., K[EVM], K[Solidity] and K[Solidity[Uniswap]]. The test consists of setting up necessary 
mock token contracts and executing `testSwapSingleHopExactAmountIn` (line 706 to 723 of [swaps.sol](../src/swaps.sol)) 
1000 times via a `while` loop. The `testSwapSingleHopExactAmountIn` consists of setting up the necessary environment,
such as depositing, approving and transferring sufficient tokens in order to make the required `swapSingleHopExactAmountIn`
function call as seen in line 720 of [swaps.sol](../src/swaps.sol).

**NOTE:** You would require Docker to be [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) to run the following commands.

### GO Ethereum (Geth)

To build and execute the docker image for measuring UniSwap 1k swaps on Geth, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo docker build . --file=Docker/geth.Dockerfile -t uniswap02-on-geth
sudo docker run -t uniswap02-on-geth
```

### Solidity-Lite Semantics in K (K[Solidity] and K[Solidity[Uniswap]])

To build and execute the docker image for measuring UniSwap 1k swaps on Solidity-Lite Semantics with and without summarization/optimization, 
,i.e., K[Solidity[Uniswap]] (optimized for Uniswap) and K[Solidity], run the following commands:
```bash
sudo docker build . --file=Docker/solidity.Dockerfile -t uniswap-on-solidity
sudo docker run -t uniswap-on-solidity
```

### Summary of measurements collected
> Measurements were taken on 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K 24-Core CPU (32 threads), with IntelÂ® UHD Graphics 770 (Integrated with CPU) and 64GB RAM.

| Implementation | Time to run 1K swaps | Overhead | Speed |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **GETH** | 0.248s | 1x | 100% |
| **K[Solidity]** | 0.259s | 1.04x | 95.8% |
| **K[Solidity[Uniswap]]** | **0.152s** | **0.61x** | **163%** |

> **Note:**
> - The Overhead and Speed calculated are based on using Geth as baseline.
> - The lower the Overhead value is, the faster it is as compared to Geth.
> - The higher the Speed value is, the faster it is as compared to Geth.
> - Speed = 1 / Overhead

## Math Proof Generation (MPG) and its measurements

This section includes instructions to reproduce the tables as seen in the end of this section.
For each benchmark semantics, namely K[Solidity] and K[Solidity[Uniswap]], we measured on 3 different transaction programs:
- [uniswap_addLiquidity.txn](../src/uniswap_addLiquidity.txn)
- [uniswap_swapSingleHopExactAmountIn.txn](../src/uniswap_swapSingleHopExactAmountIn.txn)
- [uniswap_swapSingleHopExactAmountOut.txn](../src/uniswap_swapSingleHopExactAmountOut.txn)    
Each of the transaction programs consists of executing different test/function calls from the 
[UniswapV2SwapRenamed.sol](../src/UniswapV2SwapRenamed.sol) contract.
